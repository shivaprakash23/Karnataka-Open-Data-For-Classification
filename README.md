# Open Data For Classification
 What is object detection and image classification?
 
 Object detection using satellite data refers to the process of identifying and locating specific objects or features within satellite imagery. This technique is widely used in various fields such as agriculture, urban planning, environmental monitoring, disaster management, and defense. The goal is to automatically detect and classify objects of interest (e.g., buildings, roads, vehicles, vegetation, water bodies) from images captured by satellites.
 
This project focuses on collecting various labels from satellite data, such as stadiums, parks, canals, and locations of invasive species. It specifically targets certain labels within the Karnataka region, with the data provided in shapefile format.
